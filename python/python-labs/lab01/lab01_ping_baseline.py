Lab 01 — Ping & Latency Baseline (ICMP)

Purpose:
- Measure ICMP reachability and latency
- Treat failure as data, not an exception
- Produce both human-readable and JSON output

This script intentionally avoids crashing on network failure.

# LAB 01 — Ping + Latency Baseline (ICMP)
#
# 1. Inputs:
#    - A list of network targets (IP addresses or hostnames)
#    - A ping count (number of attempts per target)
#
# 2. Outputs:
#    - A JSON file (outputs/baseline.json) containing per-target ping statistics
#    - A readable summary printed to stdout
#
# 3. Success:
#    - Targets are reachable with a high success rate
#    - Latency values (min/avg/max) are recorded for successful pings
#
# 4. Failure:
#    - Failed pings are recorded without latency
#    - The script continues running and does not crash on errors
